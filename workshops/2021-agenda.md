Rough Agenda (Pacific Time):
 
**Morning**: 2 x 90 min sessions with 10-15 min talks on
recent/current research activities + group discussion

**Afternoon**: Staggered topical breakout sessions for further
  discussion + wrap up discussion
 
The afternoon will be focused on informal discussions in smaller
groups. We anticipate that most people will only participate in 1-2
breakouts, so you will have more breaks in the afternoon.
