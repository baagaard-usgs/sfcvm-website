# 3D Geologic Models

## USGS 2008

3D geologic model underlying the USGS San Francisco Bay region 3D
seismic velocity model version 08.3.0. The model is a hierarchy of
fault surfaces that divide the volume of interest into fault
blocks. These fault blocks are further subdivided by zone surfaces
that most commonly represent contacts between rock units within a
fault block.
